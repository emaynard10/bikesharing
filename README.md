# Bikesharing NYC CitiBike Data
#### Tools: Tableau

### Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use data from NYC Citi Bike sharing program to better undersand how the program can be deployed in another city such as Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis uses Tablaeu to tell the story of the bike sharing data. With the visualizations certain trends with the bikes can be extracted for further application to Des Moines. 

### Results: 
The story can be viewed on Tablaeu Public at this [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikesharingChallenge_16579252762180/CitiBikeAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

The first visualiztion shows how many bikes are check out for how long. The chart is important in determining how long the checkout times are and clearly shows that most bikes are used for ten minutes and are rarely used for over 40 minutes. This leads to the assumptions that the bikes are mostly used for commuting.

This image shows that the target customer is the male who commutes to work and has subscribed to the program (shown in the next image).

The graph showing trips by weekday also reveals that there is steady use of the bikes on weekends all throughout the day.

Here it is comfirmed that there need to be plenty of bikes staged at popular pickup stations before 8 in the morning and during the rush hours between 4pm and 7pm. It is also worth noting that the bike use doesn't stop at 7pm, so there should be plenty of bikes near bars and restaurants for use in the evenings.

This map helps to show which stops should be targeted during peak hours and that maintenance at these stops will likely need to occur in the middle of the day on weekdays or in the middle of the night. Bikes that are not getting much use can be roated to  popular start stations such as the ones in the map. 

### Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
The analysis focuses on trends in gender, trip duration, trip location, and length and times of trips. The analysis woulf really benefit from some data from Des Moines, the city for the future bike program. A few things to know about Des Moines would be, what is traffic like and are the streets bikeable, ie. are there lots of hills or is it flat? Does the weather allow for good biking conditions for most of the year? What are the distances like from public transportation stops to downtown? What are the distances from residences and neighborhoods to downtown? Where are the biggest tourist attractions? Questions like these can help determine some of the similaries and differences between New York City and Des Moines and can strength the analysis. The comparison of the two cities can also lead to descisions about how many bikes and where to put them. 

Some additional visualiztions could also benefit the analysis. Once the bike program is underway it is worth knowing how the bikes are being utilized to plan the proper maintenance and rotations. Some thing like this image shows that there are inevitably some bikes with more rides that others. It would also be useful to know more about what landmarks are near the start and end stations. A map with transit data layed over the stop and start bike locations could help visualize how the bikes relate to transit and how important that is for planning locations.
